# Northpoint Software Expand Reach Initiative
Northpoint Software, a company specializing in games and educational software, faced challenges in expanding its customer base through mailing campaigns. To address the modest 5.3% response rate from a test sample, the company decided to build predictive models to enhance targeting efforts.To achieve this, two predictive models were developed. A forward stepwise logistic regression was chosen as the best classifier. This model, with an accuracy of 78.71% and a sensitivity of 74.39%, helps identify potential purchasers based on predicted probabilities. A forward stepwise linear regression was selected for estimating spending value. This model, with the lowest RMSE value of 165, provides the most accurate spending predictions among all tested models. Key evaluation metrics, including predicted probabilities, expected spending, adjusted probability, and estimated spending values, were incorporated into the analysis. Cumulative gain and decile charts demonstrated that targeting the top 10% of customers identified by these models yields 4.17 times more profit compared to sending mails to all customers. By focusing on the top 10% of customers identified through these predictive models, Northpoint Software can optimize its returns on investment in mailing campaigns.
